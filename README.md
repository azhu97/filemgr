For Mac users that work from their Downloads directory:

Run sudo mv filemgr /usr/local/bin/mgr (or whatever name you want) so that you can run filemgr from anywhere, including your Downloads directory.

Run mgr (or whatever name you choose) to see the available list of commands and their corresponding actions.
